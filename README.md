## Project and Team Introduction:

### Project Summary:
In order to cope with the need for food, we need to devise a way to balance supply and demand. For any country, the production of food is influenced by two main factors, natural resources and institutional support. Natural resources include fertile land, forest, water, etc. Institutional resources include local and national government bodies. Our project is going to examine the demand for certain main food sources such as milk, wheat, and soy. from different countries within a given population. Then, we are going to merge this data with expected population growth to see if the countries can sustain using that resource for the growing population or should change to something better suited to the resources available.

### Problem Statement:
For a given economic measure of a country with respect to population 
and production of feed and food, we want to evaluate what are the fastest growing countries and balance the supply and demand based on analysis of economic measures and agricultural production

## Data and Source description:

### Collecting Data:
The datasets that we used came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) for our project. The data for our food data [FAO.csv](https://github.com/ramkguru97/Group_6_6162/blob/main/FAO.csv) came from this page [Food data](https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production). The data for our world population datasets [Metadata_Country_for_World_population.csv](https://github.com/ramkguru97/Group_6_6162/blob/main/Metadata_Country_for_World_population.csv) and [WorldPopulation.csv](https://github.com/ramkguru97/Group_6_6162/blob/main/WorldPopulation.csv) came from this page [Population data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

### Data preprocessing:
We cleaned the dataset by removing all duplicate values and null values. Also, our team merged the FAO.csv and the WorldPopulatio.csv. Here is a notebook with our new cleaned and merged datasets - [Deliverable 2 Preliminary Cleansing .ipynb](https://github.com/ramkguru97/Group_6_6162/blob/main/Deliverable%202%20Preliminary%20Cleansing%20.ipynb)
