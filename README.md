Implementation of Exploratory Data Analysis

### Team Members: Arvind Suryiakanth, Calvin Moore, Ramesh Gururajan, Roy Ulrichiii

## Project Summary:

In order to cope with the need for food, we need to devise a way to balance supply and demand. For any country, the production of food is influenced by two main factors, natural resources and institutional support. Natural resources include fertile land, forest, water, etc. Institutional resources include local and national government bodies. Our project is going to examine the demand for certain main food sources such as milk, wheat, and soy. from different countries within a given population. Then, we are going to merge this data with expected population growth to see if the countries can sustain using that resource for the growing population or should change to something better suited to the resources available.

## Workflow:

### Collecting Data:
We used these datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for our project - [FAO.csv](https://github.com/ramkguru97/Group_6_6162/blob/main/FAO.csv), [Metadata_Country_for_World_population.csv](https://github.com/ramkguru97/Group_6_6162/blob/main/Metadata_Country_for_World_population.csv), [WorldPopulation.csv](https://github.com/ramkguru97/Group_6_6162/blob/main/WorldPopulation.csv)

### Data preprocessing:
We cleaned the dataset and ""

## Final Result:
